**React web app for creating and saving playlists to users Spotify account**

Used my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Features

Users can search for songs by song title.
* Also includes functionality to search by other attributes like artistâ€™s name, genre, etc.

Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried

Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account


# Technologies

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* React Application
* HTTP Requests and Responses used with the Spotify API (getting song data and posting a playlist to spotify account)
* Authentication to spotify account using url token
* Jest used for testing
