**React web app for creating and saving playlists to users Spotify account**

Used my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Features

Users can search for songs by song title.
* You can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.

Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
* You can also include other information – the design is up to you

Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account
